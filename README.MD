# JRDN Web Portfolio Site!

## Creation Process
I wanted a website that was very minimalist yet still showed off some of my personality. I love neon green #39FF14 so I wanted that to be my main accent colour but kept the rest of the color palette fairly simple by using black #000000, white #FFFFFF and grey #F9F9F9.

The site was built using the Bootstrap framework. This was very helpful in terms of the nav and basic page layout.

One of the issues I ran into using the framework was when I wanted to do certain stylistic elements, such as overlapping text with pictures and having different grid types. These stylistic choices were not supported by Bootstrap.

The solution for this main issue was the write some of my own CSS for those parts of the site.

I soon learned how easy it is to combine a framework with your own CSS and the benefits of using either method and I will forsure use both ways in the future. I didnt play around with javascript much, so hopefully I will get the chance to in the future.

I also didnt have much of my own content to populate the site, so I ended up using filler content from a free image hosting site and some Lorem Ipsum text.

Overall I am very satisfied with the final result and I cant wait to tweak it as I continue to learn, grow and develop my style as a designer.
